## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student passionate about information security with a deep interest in ethical hacking, network security, and securing digital systems. My journey into cybersecurity began with curiosity and has since evolved into a commitment to learning and growing in this ever-evolving field. Iâ€™m particularly fascinated by how technology can both empower and protect us â€” and Iâ€™m dedicated to developing the skills needed to safeguard that technology.

In addition to my studies, I enjoy exploring the world of penetration testing and vulnerability assessments through hands-on platforms like Hack The Box and TryHackMe. One of my proudest achievements has been contributing to small cybersecurity projects, including vulnerability reporting for national development organization, which has helped improve the security of sensitive information.
